# Point-Insdie-a-Polygon-implemented-in-Google-maps
This program finds out whether given location(Lat, long) is inside or outside a polygon drawn on google maps.

I had used a library called gmplot
One can install that library using following command - pip3 install gmplot
I had used python3.6
If one is using python2.7, following command can be used - pip install gmplot

Input:
1st line asks for no. of points to create a polygon on google maps
Next N lines asks for latitutude and longitude of each point
Last line asks the latitute and longitude of point which needs to be checked. 

Output will be Point is inside the polygon or point is outside the polygon
If no of points is less than 3, output displayed will be Can't construct polygon
